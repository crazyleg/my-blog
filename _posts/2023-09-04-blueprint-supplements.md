# Blueprint Supplements Analysis

I was reading the Blueprint and actually started to take a subset of recommended supplements. Initially I approached this not quite systematically, relying on my outdated knowledge and blind trust in some cases. 

Now, after few months I want to re-evaluate the list, create my own mixture and see If I can improve it. Not everything is based on good peer reviewed research, some things (like the ginseng) are based on my anectodal evidence. 

The goals here are vague - I am knot actively tracking my blood biomarkers now, as I haven't learned the way to do it in the UK yet. But I have a 5-7 years old data tracked in pretty well. I may redo the panel later in UK - just need to figure out how to do it in a country where medical system is a bit strange. As there is no biomarkers for now, I'll have to stick to subjective wellbeing.

| Compound        | TLDR           | Safety | Target  | Price / procurement | Conclusion |
| ------------- |-------------| -----| ----| ---| -- |
| Acarbose 200 mg       | 1. Blocks starch to glucose transformation, so lowers glucose and HbA1c by proxy [[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acarbose). 2. (speculative) Potentially changes gut microbiota to some "better" state [[2]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9286917/) | Very safe | Glucose / HbA1c / Gut microbiota      |12$ / Rx (hard) |  YES. Needs bloodwork / glucose monitoring. Safe and usefull (lowering glucose in a controlled fashinion is almost always a good idea). Better in combo with metformin. Gut microbiome theory is not proven (only mouse) but mouse proxy is better then c. elegans, so it is a reasonable and safe bet overall.|
| Ashwagandha | All-rounder "cure all" herb, anti-inflammatory mosty with some "anti-cancer" benefits, but all on worms and mices.  | Very Safe | insulin/IGF-1 | 4$ / easy | LIKELY NO due to no human studies and no solid proxies. Unless you have bloodwork data showing suboptimal IGF-1 levels. If so - likely a part of the mix, but IGF-1 monitoring should be in place, as too-low values are also bad. 
| B complex (methylated) | All-rounder polyvitamin. Better go for a methylated version. Needs either no explanation or a book.  | Very Safe | assorted | 10$ / easy | STRONG YES. Impossible to overdose, bunch of proven "healthy" benefits, cover all risks of deficiencies, especially if you are going full vegan. A part of a typical "nootropic" mix.
| Sulforaphane (broccoli extracts) | All-rounder "magic" compound with bunch of research on non-human or on human cells. Cures everything, but no proves for humans. | Very Safe | assorted | 10$ / easy | LIKELY NO for now due to low human evidence. Doesn't hurt in principle.
| Vitamin C | Don't start me on this. "Antioxidant" is not a thing. | Very Safe | assorted | 2$ / easy | MAYBE. Likely no reason to do so in the proposed dose of 500mg. For hard-core extreme folks if you want a chance of "effect" - go for 5-10g in a IV drip.
| Calcium Alpha-Ketoglutarate |  | Very Safe | assorted | 2$ / easy | CLEAR YES. Some good evidence on human (at least on secondary effects), anti-aging on non-human, so likely at least partially convert to humans.
