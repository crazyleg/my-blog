# Blueprint Supplements Analysis

I was reading the Blueprint and actually started to take a subset of recommended supplements. Initially I approached this not quite systematically, relying on my outdated knowledge and blind trust in some cases. 

Now, after few months I want to re-evaluate the list, create my own mixture and see If I can improve it. Not everything is based on good peer reviewed research, some things (like the ginseng) are based on my anectodal evidence. 

The goals here are vague - I am knot actively tracking my blood biomarkers now, as I haven't learned the way to do it in the UK yet. But I have a 5-7 years old data tracked in pretty well. I may redo the panel later in UK - just need to figure out how to do it in a country where medical system is a bit strange. As there is no biomarkers for now, I'll have to stick to subjective wellbeing.

# Raw notes
| Compound        | TLDR           | Safety | Target  | Price / procurement | Conclusion |
| ------------- |-------------| -----| ----| ---| -- |
| Acarbose 200 mg       | 1. Blocks starch to glucose transformation, so lowers glucose and HbA1c by proxy [[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acarbose). 2. (speculative) Potentially changes gut microbiota to some "better" state [[2]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9286917/) | Very safe | Glucose / HbA1c / Gut microbiota      |12$ / Rx (hard) |  YES. Needs bloodwork / glucose monitoring. Safe and usefull (lowering glucose in a controlled fashinion is almost always a good idea). Better in combo with metformin. Gut microbiome theory is not proven (only mouse) but mouse proxy is better then c. elegans, so it is a reasonable and safe bet overall.|
| Ashwagandha | All-rounder "cure all" herb, anti-inflammatory mosty with some "anti-cancer" benefits, but all on worms and mices.  | Very Safe | insulin/IGF-1 | 4$ / easy | LIKELY NO due to no human studies and no solid proxies. Unless you have bloodwork data showing suboptimal IGF-1 levels. If so - likely a part of the mix, but IGF-1 monitoring should be in place, as too-low values are also bad. 
| B complex (methylated) | All-rounder polyvitamin. Better go for a methylated version. Needs either no explanation or a book.  | Very Safe | assorted | 10$ / easy | STRONG YES. Impossible to overdose, bunch of proven "healthy" benefits, cover all risks of deficiencies, especially if you are going full vegan. A part of a typical "nootropic" mix.
| Sulforaphane (broccoli extracts) | All-rounder "magic" compound with bunch of research on non-human or on human cells. Cures everything, but no proves for humans. | Very Safe | assorted | 10$ / easy | LIKELY NO for now due to low human evidence. Doesn't hurt in principle.
| Vitamin C | Don't start me on this. "Antioxidant" is not a thing. | Very Safe | assorted | 2$ / easy | MAYBE. Likely no reason to do so in the proposed dose of 500mg. For hard-core extreme folks if you want a chance of "effect" - go for 5-10g in a IV drip.
| Calcium Alpha-Ketoglutarate |  |  | |  | CLEAR YES. Some good evidence on human (at least on secondary effects), anti-aging on non-human, so likely at least partially convert to humans. 
| Cocoa Flavanols  |  | Very Safe | assorted | 2$ / easy | pass for now 
| CoQ10 |  |  | |  | AT WILL. Like, antioxidants are sketchy topic, no clear proof. Lightweight proofs are poinintig to "clearly not harmfull, potentially a bit beneficial", specifically for heart health and sports performance. So, if you are into performance sports - you can do that, otherwise - stick to topical CoQ10 formulations - they are clearly effective.
| D-3 |  |  | |  | WITH BLOOD SCREENING. Benefits seems to be U-shaped, so unless you are sure that you are deficient - don't do.
| DHEA |  |  | |  | LIKELY YES, but I need to research more the correct dosage, maybe efficient dosage is too high. Seems that body composition can be improved "for free" with some cosmetic skin benefits and general hormal balance.
| Vitamin E |  |  | |  | MAYBE, not magic. Some studies have borderline detected effects on human longevity, but I suppose confounding factors are not fully controlled. Also it assumes "lifelong" supplementation. So, likely not worth it.
| Fish oil |  |  | |  | CLEAR YES, I wouldn't bother with explanation. Dose in a follow-up.
| Glucosamine Sulphate |  |  | |  | MAYBE. Some evidence on joint health, but not clear. I would say - if you have joint issues - go for it, otherwise - don't bother.
| Glucosamine Sulphate |  |  | |  | MAYBE. Some evidence on joint health, but not clear. I would say - if you have joint issues - go for it, otherwise - don't bother.
| Iodine |  |  | |  | LIKELY NO. Some evidence on imrpoving longevity, I have questions on confouding factors, not pure double blind studies. Modern food is full of iodine.
| K2-MK4 |  |  | |  | LIKELY YES. If we are to supplement out mix with anti-inflammatory components, and it is has to be the only one - this is the one. Especially worth trying if your C-reactive protein is a on a high side.
| K2-MK4 / MK7 + K1(optional)  |  |  | |  | LIKELY YES. If we are to supplement out mix with anti-inflammatory components, and it is has to be the only one - this is the one. Especially worth trying if your C-reactive protein is a on a high side.
| K2-MK4 / MK7 + K1(optional)  |  |  | |  | LIKELY YES. If we are to supplement out mix with anti-inflammatory components, and it is has to be the only one - this is the one. Especially worth trying if your C-reactive protein is a on a high side.
| Lithium  |  |  | |  | PLEASE NO. Therapeutic dose is 1000x higher then in the supplement. It is a drug, not a supplement. Suggested 1mg dose will not cause any effect.
| Lycopene   |  |  | |  | MAYBE. But after 50yo
| Lysine   |  |  | |  | LIKELY NO. 
| Metformin   |  |  | |  | LIKELY YES. 
| Nicotinamide Riboside + Nicotinamide Mononucleotide  |  |  | |  | CLEARLY YES 
| NAC  |  |  | |  | CLEARLY NO. So, I have to confess here. I vape. I think if you do vape - you should take NAC, at least as a "course" of 1m / year or similar. Otherwise risk/benefit is clearly bad for this one.
| NAC  |  |  | |  | CLEARLY NO. So, I have to confess here. I vape. I think if you do vape - you should take NAC, at least as a "course" of 1m / year or similar. Otherwise risk/benefit is clearly bad for this one. 
| Iron  |  |  | |  | CLEARLY NO. 




I am skipping Ginger, garlic, Genistein, Turmeric, Taurin, Zeaxanthin
