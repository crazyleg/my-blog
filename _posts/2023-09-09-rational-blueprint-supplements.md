# Blueprint Supplements Analysis

After going through list of supplements from the Blueprint and making some notes the TLDR conclusion is: is it quite "broad" in nature and is tring a "catch all" approach using _a lot_ of compounds with very low evidence of efficacy. 
Important note - while Bryan is hunting for immortality or indefinite healthy non-"aging", nothing in the list is capable of stopping or inverting aging. It is a "health" list, not "anti-aging" list in a way. That's not a huge surpise, as there is no true "stop aging therapy" in the world currently (it has to be genetic IMHO). 

Taking that stance and having a need to restock my supplements I'll formulate a list of reasonable supplements. I will mostly use formal research as proof points, but some anectodal evidence from my multi-year experience of experimenting with chemical interventions of all sorts. 

Let's define goals a bit better, as "health" is quite broad. Also, "health" is hardly universal, as everyone has their own unique weak points. What are we after?

- Mental stuff
  - Memory
  - Focus
  - Creativity
  - Mood
  - Stress resistance
- Physical stuff
  - Strength/Endurance/Recovery
  - Body composition
  - Skin/hair appearance
- Optimal biomarkers (most studied/proven longevity predictors)
  - VO2Max
  - Inflammation (CRP)
  - Glucose (HbA1c)
  - Cholesterol
  - Blood pressure
  - Resting heart rate / HRV

My strong opinion is that current state of science allow dramatically improving all of the above with pharmacology interventions. List is most basic, if leaves out a lot of nice biomarkers, gender/sex-specific aspects and so on. But it is a good start. Adjust based you your own needs. Also, this is a "lazy biohacker's" list. You know without my advice that you should exercise, sleep and don't burn out at work. Improssible in practice :_)

# Physical stuff

It's pretty basic - I want optimal level of critical and well-established biomarkers. The rest of a more "breakdown" and system-particular stuff (like liver biomarkers) should be studied/imroved as a follow-up. Strong foundation relies on strong basics - healthy body composition (BMI), healthy heart (blood pressure, resting heart rate, HRV), healthy basic metabolism (glucose, cholesterol) and inflammation levels (CRP).

Getting there without baseline exercises is impossible, but amount of workouts can be minimized by pharmacology.

| Compound        | Target | Dose / Price / procurement | TLDR |
| ------------- |-------------| -----| ----|
| Nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) | Insulin sensitivity, metabolism levels, inflammation, neuronal function and much more. High level of confidence. | 350-500mg in the morning / quite cheap / Amazon or whatever. | Well studied and understood biochemistry of boosting NAD+. It is known that NAD+ concetrations drop dramatically with age and NMN supplementation restores it to "pre-30yo" levels. Effects from good NAD+ level are extremely broad, impacting a lot of downstream systems. |
| B complex (methylated) | Needs to further explanations. With all the complexity of the B-related pathways and only imporant thing to stick to is "methylated" variety. | Everything. Sports and recovery, mental performance are of more focus. | Amazon / cheap. Most pills have over 9000% of daily needs for major vitamins, but overdose is impossible.  |
| Calcium Alpha-Ketoglutarate | Prevents loss of musle mass. Insulin sensitivity. Methylation profile "reversal"! | 1000mg (possible split in 2) / Amazon / cheap | In its "criticality" of action it is somewhat similar to NMN. C-AKG is proven to go down with age, supplementation clearly fixes that and C-AKG is crucial part of the most fundamental metabolic cycles (Krebbs for ex.). Worth noting that there is a range of human studies specifically for anti-aging properties with solid results (methylation profile rejuvenation) and overall improvement in key biomarkers. |
| DHEA | Body composition. VO2Max and derivatives. Hormonal profile (both genders) | 25mg (maybe up to 100mg with blood testing) / Amazon UK not available! iHerb / cheap  | Same as NMN and C-AKG: reverting "young" plasma concetration of DHEA and turning on downstream usage (for synthesis of hormons for example). |
| Fish oil | Needs no furher explanations. Proven must for cholesterol, LDL/HDL, etc. | Amazon, price varies depending on quality | Google it |
| Quercetin | Cell senescence, anti-imflammatory | Amazon, price varies depending on quality | If not the famous Q+D strategy, Quercetin would not pass the bar. But even without D. the compound has a bunch proven anti-inflammatory properties and potential for low magnitude of senescence triggering. Given that it is a major theory of aging - worth taking. I can't promote Q+D due to high chance of side effects (let's wait for clinical trial to be over), but starting just Q. sounds like a good idea. |

# Mental a.k.a nootropics

My first "brain cocktail" for university exams was given to me by my mother - a Soviet raised biochemist. Since then I've tried most of the nootropics on the Wikipedia list and some more. The best of the best are:
 - racetams family - for cycles of 1-2 months (more on cycles later)
   - Piracetam - for your first couple of cycles
   - Pramiracetam - for your next couple of cycles and later on
   - Phenylpiracetam - for "hard" cycles and "emergency" stash, as contraty to other racetams it acts immediately.  
 - Phenibut - occasional use for social anxiety and stress reduction (talk, hard convos, etc)
 - Ginkgo Biloba - for constant use

Racetams (with exception of Phenylpiracetam) need at least 1-2 weeks of constant use to start acting in the body, they slowly accumulate the effects. Usually I take them for 1-2 months, then make a break for 1-2 months. Phenylpiracetam is an exception, it acts immediately and can be used as a "booster" for a day or two.

Pramiracetam is the king of the hill, as:
 - It is not a stimulant, doesn't increases anxiety or heart rate, even opposite
 - It influences that evasive "motivation", helping you to parse thought boring, but nessesary tasks and prolonged high-load work periods
 - It has a very gentle, but noticable antidepressant side effect. Makes world just a bit brighter for free.
 - If is the strongest of the racetams in terms of memory and attention improvements
 - It was obligatory for Soviet cosmonauts, I don't care what Cohrane says, shit works.

But, practice shows, that everyone has their own favorite in -racetam family - it is very rich. They all are legal, procurement is hard.
